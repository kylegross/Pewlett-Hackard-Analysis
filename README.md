# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The goal of the analysis is to prepare for the expected future influx of employee retirements, as many employees are reaching retirement age.

### Results
There are four major takeaways from the analyses conducted.

1. In analyzing the number of retiring employees per title, it is evident that many of the executive and senior staff make up a large portion of retiring employees (namely being the Senior Staff, Senior Engineer, and Technique Leaders). That said, with 31,736 Engineers and 12,240 Staff members that are retiring, the Engineers and Staff make up the larger proportion of retiring employees. 
2. There are almost 2,000 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program within the company. Many of the eligible persons have been working at the company for a significant amount of time, and they should be granted access to the program/the program should be more widely advertised so that more employees participate.
3. In your database, you've assigned employees duplicate employee IDs. This complicates the results of the data, as we are unable to upload duplicate IDs. Be sure to assign differential IDs so that you can ensure data security from that front.
4. It would be benifical to consolidate all of the data into one cohesive spreadsheet, if possible. It was difficult to correctly link data sets, which was complicated by the duplicate IDs. That said, the consultant advises that the company take the data as an average rather than an absolute.


### Summary

##### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
When the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, the company will need to hire about 10,000 new employees. The most significant losses (by title) are Engineers, Staff, Executive, and Senior Staff.

##### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Yes, there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of employees. It will be important for Pewlett Hackard to not only provide incentives for retiring employees to stay on board until they are finished mentoring, but community-wide courses and lunch-and-learns should be utilized to impact a wider audience.
